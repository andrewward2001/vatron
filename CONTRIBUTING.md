## Code style
* Avoid using semicolons (`;`)
* Type coercive operators are preferred (`==` and `!=`) in most places, except where identity operators are required (`===` and `!==`)
* Use two-space indentations. Four spaces is too much and tabs are often rendered incorrectly
* Lambda expressions are always preferred (`() => {}` over `function() {}`)
* Ternary operators are always preferred (`condition ? expr1 : expr2`)
* Use ES6 (ES2015):
  * `const` for defining constants and requires
  * `let` for defining variables (`var` should be used sparingly)
  * Lambda expressions (above)
  * Ternary operators (above)
* CamelCase should be used for ClassNames
* Use mixedCase everywhere else
